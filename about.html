                Hello! My name is Ayaz Ali Dharejo, and I’m from Khairpur, Pakistan. I recently graduated from
                Government Degree College Pir Jo Goth. I am passionate about  frontend development. Even
                though I don’t have much work experience yet, I am always eager to learn and grow in these areas.

                I first became interested in coding because I love solving problems. I’ve been learning frontend
                development and working with tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am always trying to improve my
                skills by building small projects and exploring new technologies.

                Although I don’t have formal work experience, I often help my friends and classmates with their
                programming problems. I enjoy working with others and learning from them, and I believe my
                problem-solving skills can be useful in any team.

                I can speak English, Urdu, and Sindhi, which helps me communicate with people from different
                backgrounds. I believe good communication is very important in both work and life, and I always try to
                share my ideas and learn from others.

                In my free time, I enjoy traveling, discovering new places, and trying different foods. Traveling helps
                me get new ideas and inspires my creativity. I also like to cook, which is a fun and relaxing hobby for
                me.

                I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow in frontend development and other areas. I
                am excited to work on projects where I can use my skills to make a difference and contribute to a team.
